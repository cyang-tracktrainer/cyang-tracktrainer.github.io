            The Track Trainer is a versatile rehabilitation device that transforms rehabilitation into
            a stimulating, customizable game. For stroke patients struggling with hand and arm motor
            disability who are frustrated with current rehabilitation regimens, our device is an
            enjoyable and affordable solution that will bring recovery well within reach.

            <p>
              The Track Trainer gives stroke patients an engaging and intuitive way to improve arm
              and hand coordination, regardless of their level of disability. It can be used for both
              at-home and therapist-assisted training.

              The modular design of the Track Trainer allows it to be customized for a wide range of
              patients. Furthermore, our device's affordable price point makes it accessible even to
              low-budget rehabilitation centers.

                At its core, the Track Trainer is comprised of a track through which patients
                guide a joystick.

            <h3>Intrinsically Engaging</h3>
            <p>
              The Track Trainer was primarily designed to improve the rehabilitation experience of
              patients who struggle with noncompliance. For such patients, current rehabilitation
              devices lack excitement and are therefore difficult to use repeatedly for months at
              a time.
              <br><br>The Track Trainer, by contrast, combines technology and work-reward feedback
              systems to give patients an engaging and responsive experience. With the Track
              Trainer, patients are visually engaged by electronically controlled elements such
              as automatically activated gates and lights. Moreover, patients are inspired to
              remain dedicated to their therapy regimens – every patient has the opportunity to
              beat their personal record for lap time each time they use the Track Trainer.

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Completely Customizable</h3>
            <p>
              One of Track Trainer’s biggest asset is that it provides a treatment possibility
              for many patients recovering from motor dysfunction: there are multiple ways the
              Track Trainer can be customized to cater to patients’ varying needs.
            </p>
            <h6>Joystick Variation</h6>
            <p>
              Patients with severe motor deficits can use our specially designed joystick that
              secures their hand to the joystick. This allows patients who can’t grip well to
              still use the device. On the other hand, our round top joystick allows high-level
              patients to practice gripping an object that is difficult to hold.
            </p>
            <h6>Task Variation</h6>
            <p>
              Patients can also choose to turn certain tasks on or off. If a recovering
              individual specifically needs to practice twisting motions, they can enable the
              tasks that involve twisting while disabling all other tasks. The Track Trainer
              will subsequently only test this motion. Similarly, if a certain task is too
              difficult for a patient, they can simply switch that task off.
            </p>
            <h6>At-Home Use</h6>
            <p>
              The Track Trainer is portable and intuitive, making it an ideal device for at-home use.

            <h3>A Game, Not a Chore</h3>
            <p>
              Therapists often have trouble engaging patients with current Task Specific Training
              methods, resulting in a disconnect between the therapist and their patient. The Track
              Trainer, which provides a game-like experience, improves this relationship by making
              patients and therapist equally motivated to achieve total recovery.

            <h3>The End-All Solution for TST Therapy</h3>
            <p>
              Currently, it is difficult for therapists to quantify patient recovery via Task
              Specific Training. Track Trainer, however, is the single solution for therapists’
              Task Specific Training needs. Therapists can chart patient recovery by recording
              improvement in the time it takes their patients to complete laps around the track.
              In doing this, therapy centers can ultimately prove the healing capabilities of their
              practices. Even more, the Track Trainer’s simple design makes it one of the most
              affordable rehab devices in the market. Thus, it is the perfect product for low-budget
              outpatient rehabilitation centers.
